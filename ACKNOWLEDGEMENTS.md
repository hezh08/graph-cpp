# Acknowledgements

I have borrowed the CMake environment configurations from the UNSW course, [COMP6771](https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP6771/21T2/), which I had attended in Term 2, 2021. You can find a copy of the licence in the repository. 

I have removed the vcpkg configurations because I have globally installed all the dependencies, so if you want to run the tests you may have to manually install vcpkg along with Catch2.

I would like to acknowledge the contributors who can be found from the UNSW course [acknowledgements](https://gitlab.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP6771/20T2-cs6771-lectures/-/blob/master/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md).
